This recipe uses a single infusion mash. Use enough water to have a moderately thick mash (1.5 qts./lb. or 3.1 L/kg). Mash in the pale ale malt and flaked barley at 144 °F (62 °C) and hold for 60 minutes. Begin recirculating, add the dark grains and crystal malt, then raise the mash temperature to 169 °F (76 °C), and recirculate for 15 minutes.  Sparge slowly and collect 6.5 gallons (24.5 L) of wort in the brew kettle and bring wort up to a boil. Boil the wort for 90 minutes, adding hops at the times indicated.  Chill the wort to 64 °F (18 °C), pitch the yeast, aerate if necessary, and ferment until complete. Rack the beer, prime and bottle condition, or keg and force carbonate. If you have the means to serve this on a nitro dispense system, it is highly recommended to provide that creamy mouthfeel that the style is well known for.",
